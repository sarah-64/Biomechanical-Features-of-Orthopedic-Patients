# Biomechanical-Features-of-Orthopedic-Patients
In this repo, our data analysis is based around certain bones of orthopedic pateints. We make a KNN model in order to train our program to identify abnormal or normal cases based on specific bone metrics.

My partner, Sofia Morales, and I created this project during the summer of 2019, as part of the MOSTEC program.
